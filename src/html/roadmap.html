<!-- Imports the map with google maps API, and matches each event's attributes of location and time of day. Roadmap is per day and there's a
roadmap profile for each day as long as there's events in that day.

Default inputs: initial location (most likely home address) and end location (most likely home address).

The tuples of {eventname[i], eventlocation[i], eventtimeofday[i]} are embedded into nodes which will be set on the map as pins. These pins can be clicked and
they will specify the name of the event, the time of the event, the color (if it's routine or not).

Roadmap tool takes {eventlocation[i], eventtimeofday[i]} and:
  -sets the pins on the maps
  -prints on map the trajectory and the travel time with preferred transport method priority (set in options). Transport method changes the color of trajectory
  -Gives an error if the time between eventtimeofday[i] and eventtimeofday[i+1] > than traveltime generated by the roadmap tool + timeclearance(default)
this is the STATIC CONSTRAINT.
  -adds a time clearance after each event (marker/node), and adds this feature to the travel time shown for the trajectory that takes you to the next event.
NOTE1: can't alert if current time - eventtimeofday[i+1] > traveltime[i] (DYNAMIC CONSTRAINT) as it needs live location from user and that's for smartphones.
This functionality will be considered if app is really cool in the end.

all these 4 functionalities thanks to googlemaps API + JS + jquery -->
