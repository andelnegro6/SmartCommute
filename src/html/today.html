<!-- for today, we need a list like an agenda page:

8:00:
9:00:
10:00:
11:00:
12:00:
.
.
.
23:00:

and a button on each item @ each time to edit the event
also a button for "new event"

all events must update in all the other functionalities such as the roadmap if it has a location and in the calendar by default. -->
