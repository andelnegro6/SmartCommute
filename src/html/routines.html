<!-- for routines we need a button "add routine":
  Routine 1
    activity 1 (time, start date, frequency, location, end date)
    activity 2              ''
    .
    .
    .
    activity n              ''
  Rutine 2
    activity 1              ''
    .
    .
    activity m              ''

    Routines just have a string and the #activities as attributes. Activities are repetitive events. Can be set up daily, weekly, monthly or yearly,
at a certain time. Also necessary to address the customizability of the events such as "every two weeks", or "every 3 days", etc.
    Being routines the items and activities the subitems. Shown in calendar in watermark and shown in light color in the roadmap. -->
